        <h3>Descale Format</h3>
        <p>Descale events have a specific format designed to encourage discussion between people who would otherwise not share knowledge. Each meeting is held under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rule</a> however attendees are encouraged to take <a href="https://github.com/descale-systems/notes/">notes</a> and publish them to a central repository - after the event the notes are collated and a newsletter is published for those who couldn't attend.</p>
        <p>The events are short and start somewhat earlier than many meetings in order that people who have other commitments may easily attend. We then encourage people who wish to continue to carry on discussion in one or more group-nominated venues.</p>
        <h4>Sessions</h4>
        <p>There are two sessions with a break between them, each session is split into three tables divided up between the topics you voted for the most. There's also a wildcard table available for anybody to use when topics arise on-the-fly during the evening.</p>
        <p>While someone will generally lead the discussion on each table they're explicitly not presenting. Everybody around the table can contribute their stories, ideas and experience. Think of it as a guided group chat rather than a conference talk.</p>
        <h4>tail</h4>
        <p>During the event attendees are asked to write their name on a post-it and place it on a whiteboard under the option they wish to take after the event finishes, this allows people to immediately see where most people will be going and make plans accordingly.</p>
        <p>The options are often as following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay in the venue talking</li>
            <li>Go home</li>
            <li>Go to the pub (Optionally name one)</li>
            <li>Go for food (Optionally name where)</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
