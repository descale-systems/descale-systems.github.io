        <p>Descale is a small London-based quarterly meeting of people involved in web operations and development. We solve scaling problems by open discussion and continuous review.</p>

        <p>Meetings take the format of multiple round-table discussions about <a href="INSERTTOPICLINK">topics</a> nominated &amp; voted on by the attendees in advance, with break-out tables for spontaneous debate. Everything said by attendees is under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rule</a>, and we encourage people to take and publish <a href="https://github.com/descale-systems/notes/">notes</a>.</p>
        
        <p>We aim to ensure that people knowledgeable about the chosen subjects are on-hand to offer advice and answer questions. If you think you know a lot about an upcoming topic, please <a href="INSERTEMAIL">let us know</a>.

        <p>If you'd like to attend Descale, please sign up to <a href="MAILINGLIST">our mailing list</a>, follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/descale_ldn">on twitter</a>, or join our <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23descale&hostname=irc.freenode.net&port=7000&ssl=1">IRC channel</a>.</p>
        

        <h3>Scheduled Descaling</h3>
        <p>The next Descale meeting will be on <b>September 21st</b> at 6pm. If you'd like to attend, please <a href="EVENTBRITE">sign up on Eventbrite</a>.</p>

        <h3>/etc</h3>
        <p>We expect everybody attending Descale to abide by our <a href="conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a></p>
        <p>While we encourage attendees to continue discussions afterward in the nominated pub, we ask that you drink responsibly - nobody likes being in an argument about MongoDB with a drunk.</p>
        <p>Descale events in other cites are absolutely welcome. Please <a href="">get in touch</a> and we'll delegate a subdomain.</p>
