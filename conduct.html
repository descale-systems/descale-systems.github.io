        <h3>Descale Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>
        A code of conduct applies wherever we gather. This is true both in person and online.
        </p>

        <ul class="rules">
            <li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don't make exclusionary jokes. Don't even make them "ironically".</li>
            <li>Don't harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
            <li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here - knowledge is not a competition.</li>
            <li>Although we occasionally may meet in a pub, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol. Don't question anyone's choice of drink. If you do decide to drink alcohol, please do so responsibly - nobody likes being in an argument about MongoDB with a drunk.</li>
            <li>We'd rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
            <li>Discussion of how to make Descale more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this "has gone too far" aren't.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have any concerns about someone's behaviour please let us know either in person, or by emailing <a href="mailto:fixme@gmail.com">fixme@gmail.com</a>.</p>
